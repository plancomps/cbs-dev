# Introduction

This web site illustrates how CBS specifications of languages and funcons could be displayed using $$\LaTeX$$, Markdown, and MathJax.
The aim is to make CBS on web pages look like the CBS in published papers, i.e., using mathematical symbols instead of plain text.
(This might also make CBS a bit more attractive to theoretically-minded colleagues...)

Jekyll renders the page using kramdown to transform Markdown with math blocks to HTML with embedded $$\LaTeX$$.
MathJax then transforms the embedded $$\LaTeX$$ to web content.
Global features (such as whether displays are centred or flush left) can easily be adjusted in the configuration file.
