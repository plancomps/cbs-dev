# Introduction

The [Macros] page explains how to mark up CBS specifications when using the `cbs-latex` package.
It also links to the definitions of the macros for use with LaTeX and MathJax.

The [Samples] page links to the source files of CBS specifications that have been marked up for use with the `cbs-latex` package,
and to the results of formatting them to produce PDFs and web pages.

The [Testing] page explains how PDFs and web pages are produced from marked-up CBS specifications using LaTeX and MathJax.

The [Issues] page on GitHub is to list known problems with the quality of PDFs and web pages when using `cbs-latex`.
(The repository is currently private, and visible only to collaborators of the PLanCompS organisation on GitHub.)
